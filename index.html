        <p>I am always happy to help if I can do so !
            So far my coding knowledge is few so I guess it would be more a comfort help..
            Also I am a very good listener (even for bad jokes go ahead ;) )</p>

<div class="funny-story">
        <h3>A funny story :</h3>

        <p>It's actually also kind of a sad story..
            As kids, my sister, my brother and me were super addicted to TV.
            From out of school to sleeping time, we would basically be in front of TV (doing our homeworks in the same time, switch to catch-up another program during publicities..). Then when we were punished, the punition was obviously no-TV and my father would take the remote control to his work (since when he hid it, we would search and find it..).
            So the solution was : we bring our pocket money together and bought a universal remote control.</p>

        <h4>TL;DR</h4>
